# Podcast Languages

Podcast Language is defined in the `channel`part of an RSS as `<language>en-US</language>`, this particular definition declares **English** and **US, United States of America** variant. This is default as RSS and Podcasting in large were invented in the USA.



But Podcasting is larger that just one language and a default definition.



ISO-639 and it's sub-variants declare about 7000 spoken languages, minus the signed languages as they does make any sense in a spoken context as audio podcasts are.



These definitions has been collected and arranged to enable language tagging in a podcasting context to allow for a much more fine-grained mapping of languages, most podcasting hosting companies are running an outdated and sometimes flat out wrong list of defined languages.
